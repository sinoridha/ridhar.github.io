I build some app that exist on Play Store (Android).

*Check this:*

**Zikir Indonesia**  - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zikirindonesia
My first app, that I build base on my needs of an zikr app that include a counter feature on each zikr. Now this App also have Al-Quran and translation and have a special feature, Khatam prediction date.

**My IP Now** - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.com.ridhar.ipapp

**JR Plan Poker** - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ridhar.planningpoker
